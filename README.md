# What is this?

An Expansion case for the VZ200 with FreeCAD and STL files for 3D printing.

The original dimension have been used as best able to determine so that this case is suitable for recreating existing available hardware. The 3D model has been printed and fits the VZ200 expansion port OK.

Looking at the measurements, an 44x2 pin edge connector (last seen here https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/5pc-Industrial-Card-Edge-Slot-Socket-Connector-22x2P-44P-2-54mm-0-1-Right-Angle/133446391140) will fit.

# The Relevant Files

|File|Description|

|Base.stl|The bottom part of the case to 3D print.|
|TopCover.stl|The top part of the case to 3D print.|
|TopAndBase.stl|Both top and bottom parts for 3D printing in one session.|
|Expansion.FCStd|The FreeCAD file for editing the original model and exporting STL.|
