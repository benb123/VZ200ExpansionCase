# What is this?

A FreeCAD Expansion case for the VZ200.

The original dimension have been used as best able to determine so that this case is suitable for recreating existing available hardware. The 3D model has been printed and fits the VZ200 expansion port OK.

Looking at the measurements, an 44x2 pin edge connector (last seen here https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/5pc-Industrial-Card-Edge-Slot-Socket-Connector-22x2P-44P-2-54mm-0-1-Right-Angle/133446391140) will fit.
